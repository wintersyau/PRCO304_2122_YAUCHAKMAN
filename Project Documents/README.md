Project Vision - 
      My project is plan to design a computer program to detect the Keylogger when the computer startup.  The second aim of my project is deletion the Keyloggers after the detection.  Although there have some paid or free anti-free keylogger program, but we donâ€™t know the program is safety or not if there is a back door of the program which will leading to lost the data security.  During the designing and developing the program, I think it will make me completely to understand what the keylogger done and how to avoid it in stealing the data.
    	In my project, I would try to write up the software program by using the computer languages for Keylogger detection and deletion program.  The target OS of my project would be Microsoft Windows.  The reason of choosing Windows as my target OS because it is a very common OS which mostly used by computer users and me.  The second reason is Windows OS may easily attack by hackers by using Keyloggers when compare with other OS.
For the program languages in writing up the program, I would like to research the information first and decide upon the approval of the project. 
As mentioned above, there are some paid or free anti-free Keyloggers program in the market, we did not know the level of safety.  Thus the methods of my project may be 1) Develop a new Anti-Keylogger program or 2) Refine and amend the existing program for better functions.  It may be confirmed once the project is approved and discussed with my supervisor after complete the research.
